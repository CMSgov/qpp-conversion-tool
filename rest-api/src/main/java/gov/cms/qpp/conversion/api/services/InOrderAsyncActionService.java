/**
 * A service extends from this to help it asynchronously do something in a guaranteed fashion.
 *
 * The main point of entry is {@link #actOnItem(Object)}.  A service extending this class would call {@link #actOnItem(Object)}
 * and implement {@link #asynchronousAction(Object)} to do an action given that item.  This class handles all the error handling
 * and retries so you don't need to in {@link #asynchronousAction(Object)}.  For multiple calls to {@link #actOnItem(Object)},
 * the actions will complete in the order that they were passed in.
 *
 * This allows an application not to deal with distributed transactions and having to solve the problem of how to rollback a
 * distributed transaction.  In lieu of a standard transaction contract, this gives the application eventual consistency.
