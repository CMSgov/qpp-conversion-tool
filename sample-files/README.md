These 2 files cover all of the ACI and IA measures.
Other information about the files:

Both files contain all improvement activities for the 2017 performance period.
Some of the advancing care information measures are mutually exclusive, such as ACI_EP_1
(ePrescribing) and ACI_LVPP_1 (Proposed ePrescribing Exclusion). Sample1 contains all
advancing care information measures except the exclusion identifiers (e.g.,
include ACI_EP_1 but not ACI_LVPP_1). Sample 2 also contains all but with the
exclusions (e.g., include ACI_LVPP_1 but not ACI_EP_1). The attestation identifiers
are not included.
