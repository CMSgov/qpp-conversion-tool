Platforms and devices that collect patient-generated health data (PGHD) must do so with an active feedback loop, either providing PGHD in real or near-real time to the care team, or generating clinically endorsed real or near-real time automated feedback to the patient, including patient reported outcomes (PROs). Examples include patient engagement and outcomes tracking platforms, cellular or web-enabled bi-directional systems, and other devices that transmit clinically valid objective and subjective data back to care teams. Because many consumer-grade devices capture PGHD (for example, wellness devices), platforms or devices eligible for this improvement activity must be, at a minimum, endorsed and offered clinically by care teams to patients to automatically send ongoing guidance (one way). Platforms and devices that additionally collect PGHD must do so with an active feedback loop, either providing PGHD in real or near-real time to the care team, or generating clinically endorsed real or near-real time automated feedback to the patient (e.g. automated patient-facing instructions based on glucometer readings). Therefore, unlike passive platforms or devices that may collect but do not transmit PGHD in real or near-real time to clinical care teams, active devices and platforms can inform the patient or the clinical care team in a timely manner of important parameters regarding a patient’s status, adherence, comprehension, and indicators of clinical concern.",

These might include, but are not limited to, the NCQA Diabetes Recognition Program (DRP) and the NCQA Heart/Stroke Recognition Program (HSRP);• Use pre-visit planning, that is, preparations for conversations or actions to propose with patient before an in-office visit to optimize preventive care and team management of patients with chronic conditions;• Use panel support tools, (that is, registry functionality) or other technology that can use clinical data to identify trends or data points in patient records to identify services due;• Use predictive analytical models to predict risk, onset and progression of chronic diseases; and/or• Use reminders and outreach (e.g., phone calls, emails, postcards, patient portals, and community health workers where available) to alert and educate patients about services due; and/or routine medication reconciliation.",

    "description": "The measure calculates the percentage of a physician’s patients who have a continuity index of at least 0.7 (excluding patients with < 2 primary care visits during the measurement period). This is a physician-level measure for use in evaluating physician behavior; it leverages a previously validated continuity index that quantifies the extent to which patients experience continuity of provider in their primary care visits.\r\n\r\nThis measure evaluates the extent to which primary care physicians (PCPs) are supporting the continuity of care of their patients. High care continuity is shown to improve patient outcomes and physician well-being, is associated with decreased health care costs (total, ED, inpatient, primary care, and costs for specific conditions or treatments) and health care utilization (ED visits and hospitalizations). As a byproduct of building a trusting relationship over time, issues of equity and social risk can be addressed. Physicians who perform better are likely to have specific structures and processes in place that are conducive to allowing patients to achieve higher care continuity. \r\n\r\nCompared to lower scores (e.g., 0.6 or lower), continuity index scores of 0.7 or higher have been associated with significantly lower Medicare expenditures and significantly lower odds of hospitalization.1 \r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n1.

    "description": "Episode-based cost measures represent the cost to Medicare for the items and services provided to a patient during an episode of care (“episode”). In all supplemental documentation, “cost” generally means the standardized Medicare allowed amount, and claims data from Medicare Parts A and B are used to construct the episode-based cost measures.\nThe Inpatient PCI episode-based cost measure evaluates a clinician’s risk-adjusted cost to Medicare for patients who present with a cardiac event and emergently receive PCI as treatment during the performance period. The measure score is the clinician’s risk-adjusted cost for the episode group averaged across all episodes attributed to the clinician. This acute inpatient medical condition measure includes costs of services that are clinically related to the attributed clinician’s role in managing care during each episode from the clinical event that opens, or “triggers,” the episode through 30 days after the trigger.",

The measure excludes costs from a defined list of services that are unlikely to be influenced by the clinician's care decisions and are thus considered unrelated to the index admission.
