parameter-store :
  Used to retrive (sensitive) custom environment variabe stored in EC2 system manager parameter store (To store sensitive values we use system manager-parameter store).

Phases :
  Required sequence. represents the commands codebuild runs during each phase of build. different phases of build steps defined below.

install :
  install phase only for installing packages in the build environment.  example we can install code testing framework such as mocha.

runtime-versions phase :
  runtime-versions phase specifying run time version of the build.

commands phase:
  Contains a sequence of scalars, where each scalar represents a single command that CodeBuild runs during installation. CodeBuild runs each command, one at a time, in the order listed, from beginning to end.

pre_build phase :
  Represents the commands, if any, that CodeBuild runs before the build. For example, you might use this phase to sign in to Amazon ECR, or you might install npm dependencies.

pre_build/commands :
  Required sequence if pre_build is specified. Contains a sequence of scalars, where each scalar represents a single command that CodeBuild runs before the build. CodeBuild runs each command, one at a time, in the order listed, from beginning to end.

build phase :
  Represents the commands, if any, that CodeBuild runs during the build.

build/commands :
  Represents the commands

post_build :
  Represents the commands, if any, that CodeBuild runs after the build. example: slack notification

post_build/commands :
  Represents the commands

artifacsts :
  location for build output artifacts
